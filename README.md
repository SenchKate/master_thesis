# Master thesis code


My master's thesis is dedicated to training and analyzing models, which could take different modalities of remote imagery as input. The goal of my work was to train a classifier, which could merge different modalities in one common subspace and then classify the samples from there. The work includes the analysis of the subspace and the classification. A detailed description of my work with conclusions can be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/wmtrjvhqjqtc I hope that you will enjoy reading my research.

The code is attached to the master thesis: "Modality-invariant classifier of remote sensing images using cross-modal learning". 
The work uses https://github.com/cuishuhao/ACMR. 

The code processes SEN12MS dataset: https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1474000
